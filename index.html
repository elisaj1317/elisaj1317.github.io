          Bio:
        </h2>
        <p>
          I live in Indian Head Park, IL. However, I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I will be a Junior in the fall at Lyons Township High School in LaGrange. I have a Yorkie named Bella who is 2 years old. I spend my free time reading, watching <a href = "https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>, playing video games, and giving Bella walks. My favorite video game series is The Legend of Zelda, but the first video game I played was Kingdom Hearts. I love to travel. I go to Puerto Rico once a year and I love visiting new places. I  want to go to Italy, France, and England in the future.
